<h1>Tutotial: Contrast Variation</h1>
<p> Tutorial contributors: Andreas Haahr Larsen</p>
	
<h4>Before you start</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Download and install <a href="https://www.sasview.org">SasView</a> (needed for Part XX-XX</li>
	</ul>
	
<h4>Learning outcomes</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Understand contrast variation in small-angle scattering</li>
	<li>Perform a virtual contrast match experiment</li>	
	</ul>
	
<h4>Part 1: Monodisperse spheres with various contrasts</h4>
	<p>Go to: <a href="https://somo.chem.utk.edu/shape2sas/">Shape2SAS</a>, and simulate a spheres with a 50 Å radius and contrast (Delta SLD) of 1 as model 1 and a sphere with contrast -1 as Model 2 (set parameters and press Submit)</p>
	<p>Comment the resulting scattering. Try to vary the contrast. How would a numerically larger DeltaSLD be observable in an experiment? (<a href="hint1.html">Hint</a></p>)

<h4>Part 2: Core-shell spheres</h4>
	<p>Go to: <a href="https://somo.chem.utk.edu/shape2sas/">Shape2SAS</a>, and simulate a spherical core-shell particle with inner radius of 30 Å and core dSLD of -1, and outer radius of 50 Å and shell dSLD of 1.</p>
	<p>Comments on the results. Try to compare with a sphere with radius 30 Å or 50 Å (as Model 2). Adjust the radii of the core-shell particle to get an I(0) of 0. (<a href="hint1.html">Hint</a></p>)</p>
	<p>Download the simulated data for Model 1: Isim.dat. <a href="Isim.dat">example data</a></p>
	<p>Load into SasView and fit a <a href="https://www.sasview.org/docs/user/models/core_shell_sphere.html">core-shell sphere form factor</a>. The result may look like this:</p>
	<img src="SasView_CoreShell.png" style="width:1000px"/>
	<p>Are the fitted values the same as the input values. Can you fit with different combinations of sld_core, sld_shell and sld_solvent? why? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babinet%27s_principle>hint</a>"</p>. 
	<p>what happens if you fit both sld_core, sld_shell and sld_solvent? why? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation">hint</a></p>

<h4>Part 3: A virtual contrast-variation experiment</h4>
    <p>This part is inspired by <a href="doi:10.1111/febs.14345">Midtgaard et al 2018</a>, where a detergent DDM is matched-out in SANS to get the scattering from a membrane protein without the detergent signal.</p>
    <p>Go to: <a href="https://somo.chem.utk.edu/shape2sas/">Shape2SAS</a>, and simulate a cylinder with radius 30 Å and length 90 Å and dSLD of 2. This is our simplistic model of an integral membrane protein.</p>
	<p>The transmembrane part of the  protein is hydrophobic, and therefore need to be solubilized in an actual experiment.</p>
	<p>In Shape2SAS, make as Model 2 a cylinder as before, but this time surrounded by a ellipsoidal core-shell particle, which is a model for a detergent micelle. Input parameters and output could look like this:</p>
    <img src="Shape2SAS_ProteinMicelle.png" style="width:1000px"/>
	<img src="Shape2SAS_ProteinMicelle2.png" style="width:1000px"/>
	<p>We consider the situation, where the scientist is interested in finding the shape of the protein (here: the cylinder), and not the detergent micelle (here: the core-shell ellipsoid). </p>
	<p>The whole system (protein+micelle) can be fitted simultaneously (see, eg., <a href="doi:10.1107/S1399004714016678"<Perez and Koutsioubas et al, 2015</a>), but the shape can be determined more precisely, if the scattering signal from the micelle could be removed.</p>
	<p>This can be achieved in SANS, by deuteration. First step is to partly deuterate the detergents, so head and tailgroups have the same scattering, i.e. replace some H's by D's. </p>
	<p>Make a naive simulation of this, by changing the dSLD of the ellipsoid to the same value, e.g. 3.</p>
	<p>Now, simulate that the solvent is replaced from H20 to D20. Simulate this by decreasing the dSLD of all elements by 3, so the dSLD of the ellipsoid is 0 and dSLD of the cylinder is -1. Now compare with Model 1 (protein without detergent).</p>
	<p>Download the simulated data for Model 2 (with contrast-matched DDM): Isim_2.dat. <a href="Isim_2.dat">example data</a>, load into SASView and fit with a <a href="https://www.sasview.org/docs/user/models/core_shell_sphere.html">cylinder form factor</a>.</p>
	<p>The results may look like this:</p>
	<img src="SasView_cylinder.png" style="width:1000px"/>
	<p>OBS: note that the simulated data is made with a finite number of points and placed at random in the user-defined volume, so the the fits are not perfect. Not unlike a fit to experimental data.</p>
