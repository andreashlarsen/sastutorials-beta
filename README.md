- Please edit/improve/extend tuturials.    
- You can also add a new tutorial in two simple steps:    
1) add an tutorial in index.html (e.g. use the tutotrial Spheres snippet as template).   
2) download an existing tutorial folder (e.g. Spheres), and use as template for the new tutorial.    
3) upload the new tutorial folder. The folder should contain everything related to that tutorial (extra html pages, images, files, etc).
