- Please edit/improve/extend tuturials.    
- You can also add a new tutorial in a few simple steps:    
1) add an tutorial in index.html (e.g. use the tutotrial Spheres snippet as template).     
2) download an existing tutorial folder (e.g. Spheres/Spheres.html), and use as template for the new tutorial (NewTutorial/NewTutorial.html).        
3) add an image (preferably square format) that will be the tuturial logo on the front page, and is references in index.html. 
4) test if everything is looking right by opening NewTutorial.html in your browser.
5) upload the new tutorial folder. The folder should contain everything related to that tutorial (extra html pages, images, files, etc).
