<h1>Reduced &chi;<sup>2</sup></h1>
<p>&chi;<sup>2</sup> is the sum of the normalized and squared residuals:</p>
<p>&chi;<sup>2</sup> = &Sigma;<sub>i</sub>((I<sub>model,i</sub>-I<sub>experiment,i</sub>)/&sigma;<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>And the reduced &chi;<sup>2</sup> is &chi;<sup>2</sup> divided by the number of degrees of freedom (DoF). In most cases, DoF = N-K, where N is the number of data points and K is the number of fitted parameters in the model:</p>
<p>Reduced &chi;<sup>2</sup>  = &chi;<sup>2</sup>/(N-K).</p>
<p>It is always the reduced &chi;<sup>2</sup> that is reported in fitting programs (not &chi;<sup>2</sup>), and usually just denoted &chi;<sup>2</sup> ("reduced" is implicitely assumed)... This is also the case in SasView. So when you see &chi;<sup>2</sup>, it is usually the reduced &chi;<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>When fitting a model, &chi;<sup>2</sup> is minimized. For a perfet model, one would expect to get a reduced &chi;<sup>2</sup> ~ 1, as the difference between model and data is typically about the same size as the experimental errors.</p>
<ul>Rule of thumb:
<li>If you get a reduced &chi;<sup>2</sup> much larger than unity, then the model is not perfect. May need to be improved (depending on the scientific question).</li>
<li>If you get a reduced &chi;<sup>2</sup> much smaller than unity, then the model has too much freedom (too many parameters) or the errrors (&sigma;<sub>i</sub>) of the data may be overestimated.</li>
