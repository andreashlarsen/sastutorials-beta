<h4>Part 1: Monodisperse spheres</h4>
	<p>Go to: <a href="https://somo.chem.utk.edu/shape2sas/">Shape2SAS</a>, and simulate a sphere with a 50 Å radius (set parameters and press Submit)</p>
	<img src="Shape2SAS_sphere_50.png" style="width:1000px"/>
	<p>Comment the resulting scattering. Try to compare with a smaller or larger sphere (as Model 2), and with other shapes. Notice the inverse relation: larger particles have features at smaller q.</p>
	<p>Download the data you just simulated: Isim.dat. <a href="Isim.dat">example</a></p>
	<p>Load into SasView and fit with an analytical <a href="https://www.sasview.org/docs/user/models/sphere.html">sphere model</a>. May look like this:</p>
	<img src="SasView_sphere50.png" style="width:1000px"/>
	<p>Does the fitted radius match the input for your simulations (50 Å)?</p>
	<p>Try to do the same with other shapes, e.g., a <a href="https://www.sasview.org/docs/user/models/cylinder.html">cylinder</a> or an <a href="https://www.sasview.org/docs/user/models/ellipsoid.html">ellipsoid</a></p>

<h4>Part 2: Polydisperse spheres</h4>
	<p>Go to: <a href="https://somo.chem.utk.edu/shape2sas/">Shape2SAS</a>, and simulate a sphere with a radius of 50 Å as Model 1 and a sphere with radius of 50 Å and relative polydispersity of 0.1 as Model 2.</p>
	<p>The simulated results may look like this:</p>
	<img src="Shape2SAS_polydisperse.png" style="width:1000px"/>
	<p>Comment the results. Try to vary the degree of polydispersity. Try to compare the scattering from polydisperse spheres with that of ellipsoid with semiaxes a=50,b=40,c=60.</p>
	<p>Note: a Gaussian (normal) size distribution is used to simulate polydispersity in Shape2SAS, but many different size distributions are possible in a real samples.</p>

<h4>Part 3: Spheres with interparticle repulsion (hard-sphere structure factor)</h4>
	<p>Go to: <a href="https://somo.chem.utk.edu/shape2sas/">Shape2SAS</a>, and simulate a sphere with a radius of 50 Å as Model 1 and a sphere with radius of 50 Å and hard sphere structure factor with volume fraction 0.2 and hard-sphere interaction radius of 50 Å as Model 2.</p>
	<img src="Shape2SAS_HardSphere.png" style="width:1000px"/>	
	<p>Comment the results. Try to vary the volume fraction (i.e the concentration). </p>
	<p>A hard-sphere structure factor can arise from interparticle repulsion in concentrated samples of dilute identical particles.</p>
	<p>Download the simulated data for Model 2: Isim_2.dat. <a href="Isim_2.dat">example data</a></p>
	<p>Load into SasView and fit a sphere form factor and a <a href="https://www.sasview.org/docs/user/models/hardsphere.html">hard-sphere structure factor</a>. The result may look like this:</p>
	<img src="SasView_HardSphere.png" style="width:1000px"/>
	<p>Does the fitted values match the input values for the simulations?</p>

<h4>Part 4: Spheres with a fraction of aggregated spheres (fractal structure factor)</h4>
	<p>Go to: <a href="https://somo.chem.utk.edu/shape2sas/">Shape2SAS</a>, and simulate a sphere with a radius of 50 Å as Model 1 and a sphere with radius of 50 Å and aggregate structure factor fraction 0.01, effective radius of 50 Å, and 80 particles per aggregate as Model 2.</p>
	<p>Model 2 corresponds to a sample, where 1% of the spheres are in aggregated form, with 80 spheres per aggregate. The resulting scattering may look like this:</p>
	<img src="Shape2SAS_Fractal.png" style="width:1000px"/>	
	<p>Comment the results. Try to vary the fraction (i.e degree of aggregation) and the number of particles per aggregate (the size of the aggregates). </p>
	<p>An aggregate structure factor may arise from "sticky" particles.</p>
	<p>Note: a 2-dimensional fractal aggregate structure factor <a href="https://doi.org/10.1107/S1600576720006500">(ref)</a> was used to simulate aggregation in Shape2SAS, but many different aggregates are possible in a real sample.</p>
